# Accident Report Retrieval
## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
I am creating a website that allows people involved in an auto accident to quickly find an accident report (police report) for their accident. This website will allow users to select what state they are from, and either show them an aggregate list of all police reports filed in that state or it will give them detailed state-specific instructions on what they need to do to find their accident report to send to their insurance company.

### Key Features
- Interactive map where visitor can select their state
- Live Crash reports submitted to national databases
- Lead data is captured and stored
- State-specific resources on how to find their accident report

### Technologies
This is how I am going to use the required technologies in my startup application.
+ **HTML** - I will use HTML for the application's structure. There will be three different HTML pages, the Home page, form page, and about page
+ **CSS** - Style the page that has good whitespace, good contrast of colors, and dynamic sizing of texts on different-sized screens.
+ **React** - I will use this to display the live feed of accident reports that are being uploaded around the country to public databases
+ **Service** - Backend service for submitting forms and using the interactive Google maps api
+ **DB/Login** - Store accident reports, lead data that is submitted through a form, and state selection
+ **WebSocket** - As new accidents are added to the database, it is broadcast to all other users.
